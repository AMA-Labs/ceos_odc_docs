ODC Platform
------------
The AMA (`Analytical Mechanics Associates <https://www.ama-inc.com/>`_) Open Data Cube Platform (`GitHub <https://github.com/jcrattz/odc_platform>`_) allows creation of pre-defined `JupyterLabs <https://jupyter.org/>`_ environments that use the Open Data Cube to analyze earth observation data. Each pre-defined environment is paired with an ODC index database that has some products and indexed data for those products relevant to that environment.
