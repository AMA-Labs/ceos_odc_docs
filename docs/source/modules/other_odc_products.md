ODC Platform
------------
The AMA ([Analytical Mechanics Associates](https://www.ama-inc.com/)) Open Data Cube Platform allows creation of pre-defined [JupyterLabs](https://jupyter.org/) environments that use the [Open Data Cube](https://www.opendatacube.org/) to analyze earth observation data. Each pre-defined environment is paired with an ODC index database that has some products and indexed data for those products relevant to that environment.
